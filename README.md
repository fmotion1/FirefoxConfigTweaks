# Firefox about:config Tweaks

## Hi

This is a repository for a document with the ultimate aim of creating a versitile set of tweaks to [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/). This primarily includes `about:config` changes. Eventually I'll incorporate addons, but that's out of the scope of things ATM.

Right now this is literally commit #1 and the document is in its infancy. Everything is assembled in Markdown.

## Please Contribute!

I'm positive I've made some errors in the document, or some of the configuration tokens are obsolete, etc. I'd like to know what other users have tried that made a significant impact on the speed of Firefox.
